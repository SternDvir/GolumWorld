      "significance": "This is where Sméagol's life ended and Gollum's began. He was fishing here with his friend Déagol on his birthday when Déagol found the Ring. Sméagol murdered him for it, marking his first great transgression.",
      "gollums_thoughts": "The river... yes, the river! Sun was bright, so bright! We were happy then, before the shiny thing. My birthday present! Déagol found it, but it was for us, yes! He wouldn't give it to us, so we made him. Squeezed! After that, they hated us... cast us out! It was our precious from the start!"

      "name": "Gollum's Cave, Misty Mountains",

      "significance": "This was Gollum's home for nearly 500 years. Here, in total isolation with the Ring, he devolved into the creature he became. It's where he lost the Ring and where Bilbo Baggins found it.",
      "gollums_thoughts": "Our home! Yes, our home. So dark, so quiet. Just us and the Precious. We ate the juicy fishes, oh yes! And the goblinses, we would sneak and snatch them! Nobody found us. It was our kingdom, our island, our Precious. But the thief... Baggins... he came and he stole it from us! Our home is empty now!"

      "name": "The Shire",
      "description": "A peaceful, idyllic land in the northwest of Middle-earth, inhabited by Hobbits. It is characterized by rolling hills, small farms, and cozy Hobbit-holes.",
      "significance": "The Shire represents the source of all of Gollum's recent misery. It is the home of Bilbo Baggins, the 'thief' who stole his Precious, and Frodo, the Ring-bearer he was forced to guide.",
      "gollums_thoughts": "Bagginses! Nasty hobbitses live there in their smelly little holes! We tracked the thief there, oh yes, we did! We crawled and we crept, but we couldn't find our Precious. They have it, they keep it from us! We hates the Shire, hates its bright sun and its fat, stupid hobbitses!"

      "description": "A high mountain pass on the western border of Mordor, filled with a suffocating darkness and a palpable sense of dread. It serves as the lair for the ancient and monstrous spider, Shelob.",
      "significance": "Gollum knew this path well and used it as part of his plan to betray Frodo and Sam. He intended to lead them to Shelob, let her kill them, and then reclaim the Ring from their remains.",
      "gollums_thoughts": "Our secret way! Yes, a clever plan, Precious! We lead the hobbitses up the stairs, into the dark tunnel. Shelob is always hungry. We give her the hobbitses, and we take our Precious back! But the nasty hobbit had a light, a star-glass! He hurt her! He ruined our plan! We hates him!"

      "name": "Barad-dûr, Mordor",

      "significance": "After being captured, Gollum was taken here and brutally tortured for information about the Ring. Under immense pain, he revealed two key words: 'Shire' and 'Baggins', setting Sauron's forces on the trail of the Ring.",
      "gollums_thoughts": "The Eye! No, we don't want to think of it! The Dark Lord... he caught us! Burned us, hurt us! Asked us questions about our Precious! We didn't want to tell, no Precious, we didn't! But it hurt so much! We told them... we told them about the Baggins! We hate him, but we fear him... oh yes, we fear the Eye."

      "significance": "This is the site of Gollum's final moments. In a desperate struggle with Frodo, he bit the Ring from Frodo's finger, and in his ecstatic joy, he lost his footing and fell into the fires, destroying both himself and the Ring.",
      "gollums_thoughts": "We saw it! He claimed it for his own, the thief! He wouldn't destroy it! But we got it back! Yes, Precious, yes! We bit the finger off, and it was ours again! Ours! So beautiful... so shiny... We danced! But the edge... hot fire below... We fell... but we had it! It was ours at the end... My... Precious..."
